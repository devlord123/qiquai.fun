## Key Features

- **Quai-Chain Support**: Quaifun operates on Quai blockchain network, allowing users to create and trade tokens on Quai chain.
- **Random Claim Packets**: Token creators and traders can distribute free tokens through **Random Claim Packets** that can be claimed on a first-come, first-served basis. This feature boosts community engagement and allows users to earn tokens simply by interacting with the platform.
- **$QXP Points and Airdrop Seasons**: Earn **$QXP** points for every action taken on the platform, which can be redeemed for token rewards in seasonal airdrops. This system incentivizes user engagement, with point-earning opportunities for daily check-ins, trades, referrals, etc.
- **Reward System**: Developers (token creators) earn 0.5% of every buy and sell transaction in native currency (Qi and Quai), ensuring long-term, sustainable rewards without creating downward pressure on the token price.
